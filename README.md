# Master thesis

A formalization of the MLWE problem and a security proof for a lattice based public key cryptosystem in EasyCrypt.

[`MLWE.eca`](https://github.com/oskgo/master-artifacts/blob/main/MLWE.ec) models the MLWE problem as formulated by [Lyubashevsky](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JTdW5ryznp-dUBBjN12QbvWz9R41NDGU/view).

[`PolyLWE.ec`](https://github.com/oskgo/master-artifacts/blob/main/PolyLWE.ec) models a MLWE based public key encryption scheme as presented by [Lyubashevsky](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JTdW5ryznp-dUBBjN12QbvWz9R41NDGU/view).

[`PolyReduce.ec`](https://github.com/oskgo/master-artifacts/blob/main/PolyReduce.ec) is a formalization of quotiented polynomial rings used in this work. This was written for the [SABER proof](https://github.com/MM45/Saber-Formal-Verification-EasyCrypt) by Andreas HÃ¼lsing, Matthias Meijers, and Pierre-Yves Strub but is included here for convenience.
